# Sprint Retrospective

### What went well

- The test results were easy to understand therefore easy to debug. The whole process
went great for me, and it was fun to fix any failed tests that needed to fix on my end.

### What needs to be improved upon
- The files could be better formatted. The feature files did not care much about "Whens" and "Ands".
- I worked on everything at once, which caused some unknown issues. Next time, I could work
on each feature separately to improve efficiency. 
- The configuration for IntelliJ took more time than I expected, so next time I could plan some time for configurations
before starting to test. 

### What still needs to be accomplished / what needs to be completed next sprint
- Check if the planet exists first before creating the moon, user experience feature
- Moon file uploading not mentioned in wireframe, therefore not included when testing
- Moon and planet addition is testing the number of elements, should fix to see the actual element added
- I had some issues with git, and I had to upload files directly on Github. I should fix this before next sprint.
