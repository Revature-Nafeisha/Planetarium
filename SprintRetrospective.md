# Sprint Retrospective

### what went well

The test results were easy to understand therefore easy to debug. The whole process
went great for me, and it was fun to fix any failed tests that needed to fix.

### what needs to be improved upon
The files could be better formatted. The feature files did not care much about "Whens" and "Ands".
I worked on everything at once, which caused some unknown issues. Next time, I could work
on each feature separately to improve efficiency. 

### what still needs to be accomplished/what needs to be completed next sprint
- check if the planet exists first before creating the moon, user experience feature
- moon file uploading not mentioned in wireframe, therefore not included when testing
- moon and planet addition is testing the number of elements, should fix to see the actual element added
- Didn't care about the format, but could improve the formating of the feature files: "Whens" and "Ands" 
- For the login feature, when an invalid input is provided, the alert should be "Invalid Credentials" according 
to the wireframe, but instead we have "Invalid credentials" with the "c" being lowercase. Minor issue, but I think 
casing matters when it comes to testing and when thinking about publishing those websites for everyone to see
